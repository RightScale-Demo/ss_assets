# Kubernetes IaaS Cluster CAT
Launches a Kubernetes cluster using "classic" IaaS constructs (i.e. servers/instancecs) 
and then layering on docker and kubernetes packages.
This as opposed to using a cloud PaaS like Azure container service or Google GKE.

See https://github.com/rs-services/kubernetes for code and set up instructions.
(Note currently it is located in a "demo_assets" branch that may be merged with the master.)
